 deployed at https://awesome-mcclintock-b51659.netlify.app/

 dates weren't given for all courses so sorting in form of dates is little abrupt

 I have also provided the pagination

 /api includes backend part

 /public and /src contains frontend part

 will work even if we provide partial provider, next session date, child subject
